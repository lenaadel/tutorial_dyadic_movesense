## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Required Packages

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scipy neurokit2
```

Or use the provided requirements file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Data Format

### Folder Structure
Each recording session has:
- **Sensor folders**: Named with sensor IDs (e.g., 234130000540)
- **Annotations file**: Contains timing information for the experiment
- **Multiple modalities** per sensor:
  - `ECG-*.csv`: Raw ECG signal (~200 Hz)
  - `HR-*.csv`: Pre-computed heart rate (~2 Hz)
  - `Temperature-*.csv`, `Acc-*.csv`, etc. (not used in this workshop)

### Important: Participant Mapping
‚ö†Ô∏è **You must maintain a separate log** mapping sensor IDs to participant identities!

Example:
```
Sensor 234130000540 ‚Üí Participant A (experimenter)
Sensor 234130000594 ‚Üí Participant B (subject)
```
